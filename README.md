### About our App
"Dari Sabang sampai Merauke" is a really popular Indonesian quote that makes you realize how big Indonesia is. With 1.905 million in km2, it comes with millions of people, tradition and language. With this, it cannot be denied that Indonesia also has thousands of types of food that are unique with each other. Even when the ingredient is the same, different places almost have different steps of how to make it a delicious food. But as globalization comes with this digital era, Nusantara food little by little comes to vanish in public.

This project aims to develop a mobile application that can recommend recipes based on selected ingredients.The idea and goal of this project are for those who are passionate about cooking or who are not good cooks and want to make impromptu ingredients with what they have. This app aims to solve this problem by providing an easy and user-friendly way to identify different ingredients and recommend recipes containing these ingredients. 

The research question guiding the project was: How accurately can a mobile app identify different ingredients? How does the app recommend recipes that combine different spices and herbs? The project team researches the different types of spices used in cooking and the most effective ways to identify them.

The app aims to preserve and promote Indonesian cuisine by providing users with an easy and interactive way to learn traditional recipes while also encouraging innovation and experimentation in the kitchen. By incorporating machine learning processes, the app will learn and adapt to the user's cooking preferences and provide personalized recommendations. The app will also provide users with access to a wide range of recipes from different regions of Indonesia, with a focus on promoting local and seasonal ingredients.
This team is excited to tackle this as we believe cooking is everyone's new hobby these days. We hope the app will encourage users to try new ingredients and recipes and expand their culinary horizons. Additionally the team is passionate about technology and saw the project as an opportunity to develop their application development and user experience design skills.

### Project Scope & Deliverables
Project Scope :
1. Creating a project based on Android Application
2. Can identify spices or ingredients based on data through machine learning
3. Develop a database of recipes that match the identified ingredients and recommend Indonesian cuisines
4. It is expected that the application can provide a list of foods that contain the identified ingredients through training data from machine learning
